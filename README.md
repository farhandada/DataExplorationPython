# Data Exploration and Visualization with Iris Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates basic data exploration and visualization techniques using the Iris dataset. The main goals of this project are to:

1. **Load and Understand the Data**:
   - Load the Iris dataset using Seaborn.
   - Check for missing values and ensure the dataset is clean.
   - Display basic statistics to understand the distribution and summary of the data.

2. **Visualize the Data**:
   - Create histograms for each feature to understand their distribution.
   - Generate pair plots (scatter plots) to visualize the relationships between different features, colored by species.
   - Produce box plots to observe the spread and outliers in the data.

3. **Gain Insights**:
   - Use the visualizations to derive insights about the dataset.
   - Understand how different features relate to each other and how they vary across different species.
